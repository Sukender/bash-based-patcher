Author's notes:

1. Yes, you can do whatever you want with this license. However, I
would really appreciate you to participate in the development of it.
Bug reports, comments, pull requests, and simple messages are welcome!

2. I know the WTFPL may be problematic, especially in countries not
allowing "public domain"-like licenses. Thus, the license may evolve
to something "cleaner", such as CC0, BSD, MIT, Apache, CeCILL-B, etc.
But as long as everybody is okay with WTFPL, then I don't care!

Cheers,

Sukender
